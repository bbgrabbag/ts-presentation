### Event Description
This presentation is intended for newcomers to the Typescript language. It is intended to be a broad overview of some of its most important and useful features such as:
- Compiler configuration (tsconfig.json)

### Project Overview
This project is a simple playground node environment bootstrapped with Typescript and Jest. 

### Get Started

- `git clone <repo>`
- `npm install`
- `npm run test` (Runs all tests in src/tests)
- `npm run playground` (This only runs the contents of file `src/playground.ts`) 

*For those using VS Code, there is a pre-configured set of command and launch tasks for building/cleaning/testing, etc. in the `.vscode` folder. These map to most of the npm scripts listed in `package.json`*.
